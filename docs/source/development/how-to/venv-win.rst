How To Set Up a Virtual Python Environment (Windows)
****************************************************

``virtualenv`` is a tool to create isolated Python environments.  You can read more about it in the
`Virtualenv documentation <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.  This article provides a quick summary to help
you set up and use a virtual environment.

Where's My Python?
==================

Sometimes the trickiest part of setting up a virtual environment on Windows is finding your python distribution.  If
the installer didn't add it to your ``PATH`` variable, you may have to go looking.  If you downloaded and installed
python from `python.org <https://www.python.org>`_ and accepted all the defaults during installation, ``python.exe`` may
be found in one of the following locations:

64-bit (Preferred)
------------------

.. code-block:: doscon

    C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe

32-bit
------

.. code-block:: doscon

    C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\python.exe

.. _install-virtualenv-win:

Install ``virtualenv``
======================

If you try to run ``virtualenv`` and find it isn't present, you can install it using
`pip <https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage>`_.

.. code-block:: doscon

    pip install virtualenv

``virtualenv.exe`` will likely now be found in your python installation directory under the ``Scripts`` subdirectory.

Create a Virtual Python Environment
===================================

``cd`` to your project directory and run ``virtualenv`` to create the new virtual environment.

The following commands will create a new virtual environment under ``my-project/my-venv``.

.. code-block:: doscon

    cd my-project
    virtualenv --python C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe venv

.. note::

    If Windows cannot find ``virtualenv.exe``, see :ref:`install-virtualenv-win`.  You can either add the executable's
    home directory to your ``PATH`` variable, or just include the full path in your command line.  If you aren't sure
    where ``python.exe`` is installed, see :ref:`where-is-python`.


Activate the Environment
========================

Now that we have a virtual environment, we need to activate it.

.. code-block:: doscon

    .\venv\Scripts\activate

After you activate the environment, your command prompt will be modified to reflect the change.

**while running the above command , you might have the following error:
PS C:\Users\casferna\cimservicesautomation> & c:/Users/casferna/cimservicesautomation/.venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
You must 'source' this script: PS> . &
To troubleshoot this: 
Change directory to "Scripts" using cd Scripts, once you're in the "Scripts" path use . activate to activate virtualenv. Don't forget the space after the dot.

Add Libraries and Create a *requirements.txt* File
====================================================

After you activate the virtual environment, you can add packages to it using ``pip``. You can also create a description
of your dependencies using ``pip``.

The following command creates a file called ``requirements.txt`` that enumerates the installed packages.

.. code-block:: doscon

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

This file can then be used by collaborators to update virtual environments using the following command.

.. code-block:: doscon

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Deactivate the Environment
==========================

To return to normal system settings, use the ``deactivate`` command.

.. code-block:: doscon

    deactivate

After you issue this command, you'll notice that the command prompt returns to normal.
